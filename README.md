## Collaboration & learning resources for Sienna and Julia

**Resources to collaborate on using the [Sienna modelling framework](https://www2.nrel.gov/analysis/sienna) within the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/), in conjunction with researchers from [CSIRO Energy Systems](https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space/energy)**

### Goals

- Understand the [Sienna](https://www2.nrel.gov/analysis/sienna) modelling framework.

- Understand how to run code written in the [Julia programming language](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/).

- Using the [PowerSystems.jl](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/) package, understand how to create and modify a power system to the userâ€™s requirements.

- Run and analyse a production cost model of a system using the [PowerSimulations.jl](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSimulations.jl/stable/) package.
 
Topics covered by the above include:
- Building a system from data
- Loading a system from PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl
- Parsing MATPOWER or PSS/e Files
- Adding an Operating Cost
- Working with Time Series Data

### Getting Started with Running Julia

Please start by reading the following introductory sections of [Modern Julia Workflows](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/) on how to start [running code](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/writing/) in the Julia language:

(Ignore any red highlighted sections for now - they are for advanced use.)

- [Getting Help](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/writing/#getting_help)
- [Installation](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/writing/#installation)
- [REPL](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/writing/#repl)
- [Editor](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/writing/#editor)
- [Running code](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/writing/#running_code)

#### Learning Julia Language Basics

Once you have finished working through Getting Started with Running Julia, you can start learning about writing Julia code by running and modifying the Jupyter notebook `Tutorial.ipynb` in the [julia-mit](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit) repository.

The [README file](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit/blob/master/README.md) in that repository describes [how to set up Julia with Jupyter](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit/blob/master/README.md#installing-julia-and-ijulia-on-your-own-computer).

You can also do some introductory learning by:
- reading and doing the simple examples in [Getting started with Julia](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started_with_julia/)
- reading Chapter 2 of [_Practical Julia_](https://nostarch.com/practical-julia), working through the examples by using the Julia REPL terminal interface. The file of Chapter 2 will be made available on request.

### Description of the Sienna Modelling Framework
